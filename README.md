# Cryptris

## Name
Cryptris

## Description
Cryptris is an educational game devlopped by Digital Cuisine and Cap'maths for Inria. It aims to demonstrate the principles of asymetric cryptography.

The player decrypt encoded messages using a private key, while the computer tries to do the same with a public key - which is much more difficult or impossible to do. Different modes also exist in the game.


This simplified version of the game was developed by Saradha PERIATAMBY as part of a 4th-year assignment at ESIEA for the "Applied Cryptography" course.

In this version, the player is playing solo and need to decode a message withing 2 minutes.

## Installation
You will need a basic Python environment with libraries such as random and pygame installed to run this code.

## Support
If you encounter problems, feel free to contact me.

## Roadmap
v1.0.0: Basic and simpler version of the game

v2.0.0: New mode : Player vs Bot !
